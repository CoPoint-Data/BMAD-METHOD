    title: Presentation Configuration
    instruction: |
      Gather key information about the presentation to configure Gamma API parameters.

      Ask the user about:
      1. Presentation title and topic
      2. Target audience (e.g., investors, customers, team members, executives)
      3. Desired tone (e.g., professional, casual, inspiring, technical)
      4. Number of slides (recommend 8-12 for most presentations)
      5. Format preference (presentation, document, webpage)
      6. Content generation mode (generate new content, preserve provided content, or condense)

      Document these choices as they will be used for the Gamma API call.
    elicit: true
    sections:
      - id: basic-info
        title: Basic Information
        type: key-value
        instruction: |
          Capture:
          - Presentation Title
          - Topic/Subject
          - Target Audience
          - Desired Tone
          - Estimated Duration (if presenting)
      - id: gamma-settings
        title: Gamma API Settings
        type: key-value
        instruction: |
          Document:
          - Format (presentation/document/webpage)
          - Number of Cards/Slides
          - Text Mode (generate/preserve/condense)
          - Theme Preference (will list available themes)
          - Image Options (if custom images are needed)

  - id: content-outline
    title: Content Outline
    instruction: |
      Create a high-level outline of the presentation structure. Each slide should have:
      - Slide number and title
      - Key points or content summary (2-4 bullet points per slide)
      - Any specific visual elements or data to include

      Follow presentation best practices:
      - Start with a hook/title slide
      - Set context and agenda early
      - One main idea per slide
      - Use the "Rule of Three" where possible
      - Build logical flow from slide to slide
      - End with clear takeaways/call-to-action

      Present the complete outline for user review and refinement.
    elicit: true
    examples:
      - "Slide 1: Title Slide - Presentation title, presenter name, date"
      - "Slide 2: Problem Statement - Define the challenge we're addressing"
      - "Slide 3: Market Opportunity - Size, growth, and key trends"
      - "Slide 4: Our Solution - Core value proposition and key features"

  - id: slide-content
    title: "Slide {{slide_number}}: {{slide_title}}"
    repeatable: true
    instruction: |
      For each slide in the outline, draft the complete content. Use markdown formatting:

      # Slide Title

      Main content here - keep it concise and impactful. Use:
      - **Bold** for emphasis
      - Bullet points for lists
      - > Blockquotes for key takeaways
      - Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

      ---

      The `---` separator tells Gamma to create a new slide/card.

      Guidelines:
      - Aim for 30-50 words per slide (excluding title)
      - Use powerful, action-oriented language
      - Include data points and specific examples
      - Consider visual hierarchy (what's most important?)

      After presenting each slide, ask if the user wants to refine before moving to the next.
    elicit: true

  - id: visual-guidance
    title: Visual and Design Guidance
    instruction: |
      Provide guidance for visual elements that will enhance the presentation:

      1. Image suggestions for key slides
      2. Color scheme preferences (if not using default theme)
      3. Chart/graph recommendations for data slides
      4. Icon or illustration suggestions

      Note: Gamma's AI will generate appropriate visuals, but specific guidance helps.
    elicit: false

  - id: final-markdown
    title: Complete Presentation Markdown
    instruction: |
      Compile all slides into a single, properly formatted markdown document with slide breaks (---).

      This markdown will be used as the `inputText` parameter for the Gamma API.

      Format:
      ```markdown
      # Slide 1 Title
      Content for slide 1...

      ---

      # Slide 2 Title
      Content for slide 2...

      ---

      [Continue for all slides...]
      ```

      Save this to the output file specified in template configuration.

  - id: api-parameters
    title: Gamma API Configuration
    instruction: |
      Based on the presentation configuration and content, generate the complete API request parameters:

      ```json
      {
        "inputText": "[Complete markdown from final-markdown section]",
        "textMode": "[generate|preserve|condense]",
        "format": "[presentation|document|webpage]",
        "numCards": [number],
        "textOptions": {
          "amount": "[brief|standard|detailed]",
          "tone": "[user's desired tone]",
          "audience": "[target audience description]",
          "language": "en"
        },
        "imageOptions": {
          "source": "aiGenerated"
        }
      }
      ```

      Display this configuration to the user for review before upload.

  - id: next-steps
    title: Next Steps
    sections:
      - id: upload-instructions
        title: Upload to Gamma
        instruction: |
          Provide clear next steps:

          1. Review the generated markdown and API configuration above
          2. If you have a Gamma Pro account with API access, use the `*upload-to-gamma` command
          3. Alternatively, copy the markdown and paste into Gamma's web interface
          4. The presentation will be generated using Gamma's AI-powered design

          Would you like to proceed with API upload or manual creation?
